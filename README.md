# Inroduction

In this project, we used simple evolutionary strategies for solving reinforcement learning problems. 
we implement 8 simple uncorrelated evolutionary algorithms.
Static, adaptive: 1/5 rule, self-adaptive with single σ and  Self-adaptive with multiple  σ  for (μ	, λ)-ES and (μ + λ)-ES.

you can find two files here, one of them solved the cartpole-v1 and another one LunarLander-v2.
